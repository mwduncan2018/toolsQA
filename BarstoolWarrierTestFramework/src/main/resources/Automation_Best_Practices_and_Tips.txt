// BEST PRACTICES FROM THE PLURALSIGHT COURSE
//		"Create an Automated Testing Framework With Selenium"

// Enumerations
//		Use for common values
//		Use to prevent the test from needing to store variables

// Nested Classes
//		Use to write the test as a chain of methods

// Possibly store the state of data in the automation framework

// Wait Time
// 		Make the wait time adjustable with methods in the automation framework
// 		Disable wait for some tests
// 		Add the wait for other tests
// 		Adjust the wait as needed

// Workflow Classes
// 		When something uses multiple pages, use a Workflow Class
// 		If applicable, add the ability for the Workflow Class to clean up the data it created

// Default & Dummy Data
// 		Do not waste time creating test data when it doesn't matter
// 		Use default data as much as possible
// 		Use dummy data as much as possible
// 		Write an algorithm to generate dummy data

// GoTo()
// 		Remove GoTo() from the Cucumber tests
// 		Place the GoTo() inside the methods of the page
// 		If not on the page, navigate there and then do the thing
// 		If already on the page, do the thing

// Error vs Failure
//		Error = Bug in the Automation Framework
//		Failure = The test failed
//		The report should display errors and failures clearly

// Continuous Integration
//		Run tests as part of a build
//		Allow developers to run the tests locally
//		Report the results

// DSL (Domain Specific Language)
//		DSLs allow non-technical people to create automated tests
//		Few projects get here
//		http://www.antlr.org/

// Scaling Out
//		What happens when tests take a long time?
//			Run them in parallel
//			Run them at different times
//		Data Setup
//			Dump data into a database and in a condition where data is ready to be tested
//			Avoids having to make the automation framework create the data each time the tests are run

// Sauce Labs
//		Runs in the cloud
//		Runs on a RemoteWebDriver

// Agile and Automation
//		Creating the automated tests is part of the sprint
//		Passing automated tests is part of the "Done" criteria

// Browser Versions
//		Do not test on every browser
//			Most of your tests are testing functionality
//			Most of your tetss are not testing browser compatibility
//		Have your smoke tests run on every browser
//		Have your detailed tests run on one browser
